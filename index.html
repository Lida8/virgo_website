          The Astrophysics Centre for Multi-messenger studies in Europe addresses the 
          European Commission Call to provide wider, 
          simplified, and more efficient access to the best research infrastructures (RI) available to researchers 
          in the astronomy and astroparticle physics communities. <br>

          ACME is set up to realize an ambitious coordinated European-wide optimization of the accessibility 
          and cohesion between multiple leading RI, offering access to instruments, data, and expertise, 
          focused on the new science of multi-messenger astrophysics. ACME will forge a basis for strengthened 
          long-term collaboration between these RI irrespective of location. Collaboration and user training will 
          be specifically aimed at leveling up access opportunities across Europe and beyond.  
          <br><br>
          <h3>ACME objectives are:</h3><br>
          - Implement the European roadmaps’ recommendations and act as a pathfinder to broaden, improve and align
          access to the respective RI services and data, and assess and evaluate new models for better coordination
          and provision of at-scale services; <br>
          - Provide harmonized and inclusive trans-national and virtual access 
          to world-class RI; <br>
          - Develop centres of expertise providing expert support to enable easier access for
          more researchers; <br>
          - Improve science data products management to facilitate both focused research goals
          and serendipitous discoveries, implementing FAIR approaches to broaden access; <br>
          - Improve interoperable systems for rapid identification of astrophysical candidate events, and alert distribution to the 
          network of RI and scientific consortia to optimize follow-up observations; <br>
          - Provide training for a 
         new and broader generation of scientists and engineers; <br>
          - Open the astrophysics and astroparticle 
          physics data sets to other disciplines, such as environmental studies or marine biology for the
          undersea neutrino facilities, and increase citizen engagement in scientific research.

    <h2>The kick-off meeting for the ACME project launch</h2><br>
    <p>On the 16th and 17th of September was held in Paris the kick-off meeting for the Astrophysics Centre 
      for Multimessenger studies in Europe-ACME. This HORIZON-INFRA-2023-SERV-01 EU-funded project coordinated 
      by Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) aims to realize an ambitious coordinated European-wide
      optimization of the accessibility and cohesion between multiple leading astroparticle and astronomy research
      infrastructures, offering access to instruments, data and expertise, focused on the new science of
      multi-messenger astrophysics.</p>

     <p><b>With 40 world-class collaborating institutions from 15 countries</b>, ACME brings together the astroparticle
       and astronomy communities in a joint effort to forge a basis for strengthened long-term collaboration between 
       these research infrastructures irrespective of location and level up access opportunities across Europe and 
       beyond.</p><br>
       <p> ACME objectives are to implement the Astroparticle Physics European Consortium’s (APPEC) 
        and the Planning and Advisory Network for European Astronomy’s (ASTRONET) roadmaps’ recommendations 
        and act as a pathfinder to broaden and improve access to the respective research infrastructures services 
        and data, assess and evaluate new models for better coordination and provision of at-scale services, provide 
        harmonized trans-national and virtual access, develop centres of expertise, improve science data products 
        management, improve interoperable systems for rapid identification of astrophysical candidate events and 
        alert distribution to optimize follow-up observations, provide training for a new and broader generation 
        of scientists and engineers, open the astrophysics and astroparticle physics data sets to other disciplines 
        and increase citizen engagement.</p><br>
        <p> The ACME project coordinator, Prof. Antoine Kouchner (CNRS/Université Paris Cité), and its co-coordinator,
           Paolo D’Avanzo (INAF), represent each community to ensure balance and drive cross-domain collaboration.</p>
