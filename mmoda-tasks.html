        for high-energy astrophysics, aimed to support research in the field of astroparticle physics 
        (computing astroparticle centre) by opening access to observational data from space missions in the X-ray 
        and gamma-ray ranges. VIRGO.UA can be used for student training and education. The center is actively 
        utilized in the teaching process.

        <img src="mmoda.jpg" alt="mmoda">VIRGO.UA serves as the point of access in Ukraine for the Multi-Messenger Online Data Analysis (MMODA) 
        platform.
        The MMODA platform is designed to support multi-messenger astrophysics, which involves analyzing data 
        from various sources (such as gravitational waves, neutrinos, and electromagnetic radiation) to study 
        astrophysical events comprehensively. As a front-end, VIRGO.UA facilitates the local integration 
        of tools, data visualization, and analysis capabilities tailored to Ukrainian researchers or institutions 
        involved in such studies. This collaboration helps streamline access to the MMODA platform's resources, 
        making it easier for scientists to contribute to and benefit from global multi-messenger research efforts.

          <h2>The VIRGO.UA has access to the computational resources of the Data Computing Center Of Taras 
            Shevchenko National University of Kyiv.
          </h2><br>
          In particular, a <b>new Kubernetes cluster</b> has been deployed to support the upcoming installation 
          of the MMODA platform.
          This cluster is connected to uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and can operate 24/7, remaining nearly 
          unaffected by power outages. The Data Computing Center TSNUK has received a major grant from the National 
          Research Foundation of Ukraine for equipment modernization and the construction of the <b>largest computing 
          cluster in Ukraine</b>. VIRGO.UA is also involved in the implementation of this grant and will have access
